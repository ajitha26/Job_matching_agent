# Job Matcher Agent

An experimental AI-powered agent that scrapes job postings from multiple websites and stores relevant company/job details for further analysis or matching.

## Features

* Uses **Selenium** to scrape job listings from selected websites.
* Extracts and stores company names, job titles, and other details.
* Agent-based design for extending into more advanced job-matching workflows.
* Designed to later integrate with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for richer interactions.

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Selenium (for web scraping)
* Pandas (for storing/structuring results)

## Setup & Run

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone <your_repo_url>
   cd job-matcher-agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the agent

   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```

## Future Work

* Improve scraping reliability with dynamic wait strategies
* Add richer company/job metadata
* MCP integration for context-aware job recommendations
* LLM-based job‚Äìcandidate matching

Do you want me to also generate the **requirements.txt** so you can push that along with this README? That‚Äôll make the repo immediately runnable.
